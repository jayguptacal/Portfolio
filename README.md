## Welcome to Jay Gupta's Data Science Projects Portfolio

First of all thanks for visiting my Data Science projects portfolio page.

<p>Iâ€™m passionate about the data science, data analytics, AI and machine learning as it gives me an opportunity to find the insights from the information. I have been blessed to be the part of numerous Canadian and global projects in the project management leadership roles in the field of Oil &amp; Gas, Energy, Industrial, Environmental, Financial and E-commerce projects. In my leadership roles, I have been part of numerous engineering, design and construction project successes in the Canadian market.</p> 
<p>I am <b>pursuing my passion for data insights</b> and looking for a Data Analyst or Data Analytics or Data Scientist role in the Financial, Investments, Ecommerce or Energy field.</p>
<p>I follow the the Data Science Method (DSM) process to do the projects. And based on the project, I decide what phases will be applicable for the project. Each phase is clearly shown in the below image:</p>

## 1. Banking, Finance and Investment Projects Portfolio
**First Project:** 

<a href="https://github.com/jayguptacal/BankingAndInvestments/blob/main/FinancialFraudDetection/readme.md" target="_blank">![](/image/bannerfinancialportfolio.jpg)</a>

**Second Project:** 
<b>Stock Market Analysis for SPY with Python Technical Indicators and Python Technical Analysis for Tesla (TSLA) Stock</b>

- [Click here to access the Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jayguptacal/BankingAndInvestments/blob/main/StockTradingIndicators/SP500_Technical_Analysis.ipynb)
<p>Here is a full list of activities which are covered in this notebook:</p>
- Calculate stock trading technical lagging indicators such as **Simple Moving Averages, Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), Bollinger Bands (BB), Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR)** for the 'SPY' ticker symbol
- Calculate stock trading technical leading indicators such as **Average Directional Movement Index (ADX), Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Momentum Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), Rate of Change (ROC), Relative Strength Indicator (RSI), Stochastic Oscillator (STO) and Williams %R** for the 'SPY' ticker symbol
- Calculate **trading signals for Tesla** ('TSLA' ticker symbol) with the recommendation of 'BUY' or 'SELL' or 'Do Nothing' using a variety of technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, BB, SAR, MACD and RSI


## 2. Retail, Ecommerce and Marketing Projects Portfolio

**First Project:** <b>Development of Machine Learning Prediction App from the Proof of Concept (POC) to Production Stage</b>

<p>While working for the Start-up companies, the main focus is on analyzing the Proof of Concept (PoC) of an idea, test the idea and launch the app quickly rather than fine-tuning it. Keeping this idea in mind, I have developed a house prediction application using all the steps.</p>
